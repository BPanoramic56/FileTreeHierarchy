# FileTreeHierarchy

The File Tree Hierarchy is a short project based on the creation of DOT graphs through files in the user's machine
It was initally created as a way of assisting me trough Data Structures and Algorithms (CS2420), as a way of understanding tree structures, DOT graphs and file access better
